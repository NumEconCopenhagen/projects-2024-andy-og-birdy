# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Buisness cycles and unemployment** and is about the relationship between buisness cycles and unemployment rates and how this is different across age groups. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb). We have not used a .py file in this project.

We apply the **AKU111A and NAN1** from statistikbanken:

1. dataX.csv (*statisikbanken*) 
1. dataY.csv (*statistikbanken*)
