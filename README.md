In the projects and in the exam ChatGPT 4.0 and 4.0o have been used to help writing code and check code we have written. In part 3 of the exam we also used it to explain the problem to us. 

This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from **Statistikbanken** on **Unemployment and GDP** and show that there is higher unemployment rates in declines compared to booms. We also explore how unemployment is linked to age. We find that the youngest age group has the by far highest unemployment rates and also the most volitile unemployment rates. 
3. Model project. We model a production economy with an externality and workers and capitalits. We look explore how polution affets workers and capitalists differently. Further more we also look at a simular economy but where polution only affects workers and see how the free market solution differs from the social planer solution.
