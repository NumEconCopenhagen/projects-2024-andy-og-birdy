# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Production economy with externalities** and is about a production economy where we introduce a negative externality in the form of polution. We asume that polution is a function of total labor. We look at how this changes the relationship between capitalists and workers. Furthermore we create a new economy where polution only affects workers and we see how the equlibrium is different when solved with free market mechanisms and a social planer. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb). We also have defined to classes in the py-file model_project.py

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
